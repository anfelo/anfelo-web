  shortBio:
    "Hi, I'm a Fullstack JavaScript developer who loves the beauty of great design and the power of the web. I remember 5 years from now when I started learning about HTML, CSS and the web. I didn't realize it was going to become my career path and my passion. Today I spend my time building new projects with technologies like Angular, React and NodeJS. In my free time I like to read and learn about new web technologies and practice this concepts in side projects. Iâ€™m currently learning about PWAs and Svelte (a new JS framework).",
